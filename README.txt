pzzcompressor_jojo was slightly modified to extract pzz files used in GVGNP.

afs_util cannot replace file names with the attributes in AFS archive so attributes.txt is provided for reference.
However, if you are to extract files only, it is recommend to use the python package afs-extractor.
Hope the package can be upgraded to support packing AFS archives too (I know little about python)

All tools are not designed to be easy to use, yet.
